Hi before run the code you may need to set up some stuff.
Make sure you do so in x86 not x64.


You need to connect include and libs to proper position,
 properities-vc++directories-include & library

You can find the necessary instructions here:

Add glm file to properties-c/c++-general-additional include directories


replace the current glad.c with the glad.c file in thirdParty.


If you find it still not working, ask me, I'll try to solve the question with you.
